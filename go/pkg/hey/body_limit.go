// The generated parsers read every response body with io.ReadAll before a service method
// can apply a budget, so a server answering one entries page or one message with gigabytes
// was a memory exhaustion for every consumer of the SDK. The bound lives in the transport
// NewClient builds, where it covers every request the root client, an account-scoped client
// and the generated client make: a RoundTripper that caps what a text-bearing response can
// deliver, success and error alike, before a parser sees it.
//
// A success body past the limit is refused — its first read past the cap fails with
// ErrResponseTooLarge — since a parser that buffers it would buffer it whole. An error body
// past the limit is cut off at the cap instead: the status is what matters about an error,
// and a refusal would hide it behind a read failure. Both happen at read time rather than at
// the round trip: a round-trip error is one the retry loops, the SDK's and the generated
// client's, treat as a network failure and try again, and the body would be too large again.
//
// Which responses are capped is decided by the request, not by what the server says it
// answered with: the SDK asks for application/json where a generated parser or doRequest
// will buffer the answer and for text/html where GetHTML will, and asks for */* for a blob,
// which it streams to a destination of any size (DownloadBlob) or buffers under its own
// MaxResponseBodyBytes (GetBlob), and for text/csv for an export. A server that labels a
// JSON answer as a PNG is still capped; an attachment that happens to be a text file is
// still streamed.

// deliver more than limit decompressed bytes.
